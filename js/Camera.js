	// needs raising alongside distanceScale or a pulled-back camera would
	// itself sit past the default 60-unit far plane, or leave the arena's
	// far edge clipped/invisible instead of fading out through fog. near:
	// raise this together with far, not just far alone — a non-logarithmic
	// depth buffer spreads its precision across the near/far RANGE, so
	// pushing far way out while leaving near at the default 0.1 stretches
	// that ratio thin and starves precision at distance, which showed up as
	// flickering dark stripes/banding across the ground the moment the
	// camera pulled back far enough to see it (reported on video: z-fighting
	// between the ground plane and its skid-mark/edge decal overlays, whose
	// Y offsets from it are only ~0.001 apart). Every mode using the tight
